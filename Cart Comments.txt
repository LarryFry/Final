											     ***PANIC***
										On cart.php, there is a stray "]" and I have no ides where it is coming from.


Added a carosel to the home page
	-There is a nice little library called "Slick". It works really well for carosels. It uses JQuery.


Began work on the footer

Added Cart Functionality
	-When looping through all items in products.php, every "Add to Cart" button contains
	all of the information about it's product in hidden input fields.
		-When that particular cart button is pressed, the variables are posted.
		-From there, $_SESSION['cart'][prodID][whatever] is filled dynamically.
	-Used 2dimensional $_SESSION array to hold cart values

	-Removed extra white space around image files

	-cart/cart.php loop through all $_SESSION['cart'] variables and outputs them.
