Added Cart Functionality 
	-When looping through all items in products.php, every "Add to Cart" button contains
	all of the information about it's product in hidden input fields.
		-When that particular cart button is pressed, the variables are posted.
		-From there, $_SESSION['cart'][prodID][whatever] is filled dynamically.
	-Used 2dimensional $_SESSION array to hold cart values

	-Removed extra white space around image files
