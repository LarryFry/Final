File Upload Update!



New Features:
-The File Upload Functionality Updates The Database, and uploads the image to the "images" folder 
on the web server.


ToDo:
-Need to resize the employee images. Right now they are being displayed at native resolution.
-Need to style the "Choose File" and "Upload Image" Buttons. They are stacked and ugly right now.


Bugs:
- On home/home.php the carosel's height increases whenever user tries to go into "admin mode"
on a page that doesn't have one. (detail view and cart).
