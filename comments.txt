Weird Bug:
The redirect JS alerts are echoed from the index page. Any of these alerts cause the page's
navigation to be resized slightly. I don't know why this is happening. It isn't project-breaking but
I don't have an explanation for it yet.



SQL:

Click on the paintball database, and click on the products table. Go to the top of the page where
it says "structure" and make default for every column (except ID) NULL.


Here is the sql for the employees database:

ALTER TABLE `employees` CHANGE `FirstName` `FirstName`
VARCHAR(100) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci
NULL DEFAULT NULL, CHANGE `LastName` `LastName` VARCHAR(100)
CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL,
CHANGE `Title` `Title` VARCHAR(255) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE
latin1_swedish_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL, CHANGE `ImageCode` `ImageCode`
VARCHAR(255) CHARACTER SET latin1 COLLATE latin1_swedish_ci NULL DEFAULT NULL,
CHANGE `Salary` `Salary` INT(50) NULL DEFAULT NULL;
